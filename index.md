## About Me
My name is Daniel Stuart and I am a Chemistry PhD Candidate working on various biosensor development projects. My own projects focus on building platforms to enable sensing of gases and biological molecules. However, I am involved in planning, overseeing, and completing many other projects from sensor materials development to lipidomic analysis of single cellular organisms. I pride myself in my ability to tackle any problem that arises and have gained experience in a wide array of analyses and instrumentation to this end. 

If you are interested you will be able to see a little bit about me and some of the projects I have worked on below.

### Processing and ML Analysis of MALDI Spectra
One of the major bottlenecks we faced in lipidomic analysis using MALDI-MS was the need to manually process spectra. As such I built an R script to pull in and process our raw spectra, followed by selection of consistent peaks and combination of resulting peak intensities for implementation in machine learning algorithms. This enables us to quickly process raw spectra and identify peaks of interest for further analysis and identification.
