## About Me ##
My name is Daniel Stuart and I am a Chemistry PhD Candidate working on various biosensor development projects. My own projects focus on building platforms to enable sensing of gases and biological molecules. However, I am involved in planning, overseeing, and completing many other projects from sensor materials development to lipidomic analysis of single cellular organisms. I pride myself in my ability to tackle any problem that arises and have gained experience in a wide array of analyses and instrumentation to this end.
