My name is Daniel David Stuart and I am a Chemistry PhD Candidate in the [Cheng Lab](https://chenglab.ucr.edu/) at the University of California, Riverside. I received my Masters in March 2020 and expect to complete my PhD in Summer 2023.

My role as a graduate student has involved planning, overseeing, and completing projects while managing undergraduate and other graduate students. In my time at UCR I have worked on many different sensor development projects ranging from fundamental materials design, to applied biosensors, and expanding optical gas sensing applications. I am currently completing work studying curved membrane binding proteins and investigating lipidomic differences between methicilin sensitive and resistant S. Aureues bacteria. In addition to benchwork I have taught myself MATLAB and R to streamline data processing and have implemented scripts including machine learning algorithims to aid in processing and classifying large amounts of mass spec data. As you can see from this site I also took a bit of time to learn HTML. I have worked on NSF and NIH funded research projects during my time as a graduate student and have been involved in writing various funding proposals. I also participated in a local UCR I-Corps program focused on transitioning academic research results into commercial products, which led to a recommendation and successful application to the Summer 2020 NSF national I-Corps program, with a patent submitted and further research relating to that technology in progress. Recently I have worked with a commercial partner, [Oceanit](https://www.oceanit.com/), to enable hydrogen sensing using optical instrumentation through a DOE SBIR collaboration. Through all of this many challenges have arose needing quick thinking and new ideas to ensure successful [projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.markdown %}). I pride myself in my ability to tackle any problems that arise and learn new skills as needed to solve them. To this end, I have gained experience in a wide array of analyses, instrumentation, software/coding languages and I am always looking out for new opportunities to tackle new problems and learn more skills.
